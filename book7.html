Shows how behavior and emotions shape financial decisions more than intelligence.<br>
The Psychology of Money explores how human behavior and emotions influence financial decisions. Morgan Housel argues that money management is less about intelligence and more about discipline, patience, and mindset. The book presents short stories that illustrate common financial mistakes and successful habits.

Housel emphasizes long-term thinking, risk management, and understanding personal goals. He highlights that different people view money differently based on their experiences, which shapes their financial behavior.

The book avoids technical jargon and instead focuses on real-life lessons. It teaches readers how to build wealth sustainably, avoid unnecessary risks, and remain financially resilient. The Psychology of Money is valuable for anyone seeking a healthier relationship with money and long-term financial stability.
