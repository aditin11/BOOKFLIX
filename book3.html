Teaches financial literacy, investing, and the mindset needed to build wealth.<br>
Rich Dad Poor Dad is a personal finance book that contrasts two different mindsets about money and wealth. Robert Kiyosaki compares the lessons he learned from his biological father (Poor Dad), who valued job security, with those from his friend’s father (Rich Dad), who emphasized financial independence and investing.

The book highlights the importance of financial literacy, understanding assets and liabilities, and making money work for you instead of working for money. Kiyosaki challenges traditional beliefs about education, employment, and success, encouraging readers to think differently about income and wealth creation.

Rather than offering technical investment advice, the book focuses on mindset and financial behavior. It stresses entrepreneurship, passive income, and long-term thinking. Rich Dad Poor Dad is particularly impactful for beginners because it simplifies complex financial concepts and inspires readers to take control of their financial future. The book motivates individuals to learn about money early and make informed financial decisions.
