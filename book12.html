The inspiring journey behind the creation of Nike.<br>
Shoe Dog is the memoir of Phil Knight, the founder of Nike. The book tells the honest story behind building one of the world’s most successful brands. Knight shares the challenges, failures, financial struggles, and risks he faced while growing Nike from a small startup into a global company.

Knight discusses the importance of trusting the journey, building a strong team, and staying committed despite setbacks. The book offers insight into entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership.

Shoe Dog is engaging and inspirational because it shows the human side of success. It teaches that passion and persistence matter more than immediate profits.
