<h3 style="color:#f5c518;">Carol Dweck</h3>
<p style="max-width:750px;color:#ddd;line-height:1.6;">
Explains how a growth mindset leads to learning and success.<br>
Mindset explores how beliefs about intelligence and ability influence success. Carol Dweck introduces two types of mindsets: fixed and growth. A fixed mindset assumes abilities are static, while a growth mindset believes skills can be developed through effort and learning.

The book explains how mindset affects performance in education, careers, relationships, and leadership. Dweck shows that individuals with a growth mindset are more resilient, adaptable, and willing to learn from failure.

Using research and real-life examples, the book encourages readers to change the way they think about challenges and mistakes. Mindset is widely used in schools, organizations, and self-development programs. It provides practical guidance for developing confidence, persistence, and a positive approach to lifelong learning.
