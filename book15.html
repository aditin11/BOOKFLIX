<h1>Zero to One</h1>
<h3 style="color:#f5c518;">Peter Thiel</h3>
<p style="max-width:750px;color:#ddd;line-height:1.6;">
Discusses building innovative startups and creating new value.<br>
Zero to One explores how true innovation is created by building something entirely new rather than copying what already exists. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, argues that progress comes from going from “zero to one”—creating breakthrough ideas—rather than moving from “one to n,” which involves incremental improvements and competition. The book challenges conventional startup thinking and encourages entrepreneurs to aim for monopoly-level uniqueness instead of crowded markets.

Thiel discusses key concepts such as vertical progress, startup culture, technology-driven growth, and long-term vision. He emphasizes the importance of proprietary technology, strong teams, and clear mission statements. The book also highlights the role of contrarian thinking—believing something valuable that others do not.

Rather than offering step-by-step business formulas, Zero to One focuses on mindset and strategy. It encourages readers to think boldly, take calculated risks, and build products that shape the future. The book is especially valuable for aspiring entrepreneurs, innovators, and students interested in startups, technology, and business strategy.
